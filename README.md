# A Peace Proposal for the Middle Eastern Region

> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
>
> - Ecclesiates, 3:4

Let Israel, and by it's leadership the entire Middle Eastern region, end this period of weeping, macabre and cruel laughter, and mourning; Let the entire region dance once again, and let that be both the told and untold legacy of this affair.

## I. Lies to Excuse the Truth vs. Peace to Conceal the Truth - ISCAP's Choice

Many of you wished to make lies about me, Anandarup Mallik, to prepare for 2047 when it would be declassified by the United States Government that you invaded my privacy leading to illegal and fraudulent acts including criminal medical malpractice, in an attempt to make your behaviors seem justified. Perhaps this includes a certain Israeli "spy" agency Black Cube, perhaps not - such information remains classified at the moment.

Either way, those lies have had trouble lasting, and it's only been three years.

Instead, what I am proposing is that we keep much of that classified.

In the US Government ISCAP, the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, decides what stays classified come periods of auto declassification - 25, 50, and 75 years after the fact. Typically, if information is to remain classified, it is in the interest of national security or the security of our allies. The US has suffered greatly from terrorism of all kinds, much of which stems from conflicts in the Middle East, and has a growing coalition of allies within the same region.

If a lasting peace were to be met in the Middle East, and it were to be classified information that I helped broker it via this terrifically unofficial document, and it helped bring the entertainment industry to the Middle East in an era defining way, AND this peace lasted until and past 2047, then ISCAP would have a great reason to keep much of what has happened to me classified, so you all could stop worrying about spreading lies about me to make some of your behavior seem less embarrassing.

It would be in the interest of national, if not world, security.

## II. Bring Bolstered European, Asian, and (redundant) American Investment Throughout the Region to End Terrorism and Further Refugee Crises

The fertilizer to the weed of terrorism is violence. It's pesticide? Prosperity.

Terrorism finds it's recruits in those that lack opportunity to bring stability to their families; it seems like a good option because of the lack of others. Prolonged violence in the form of "forever wars" only allows for future generations to turn further to terrorism, and wars attempting total annihilation do nothing but leave lasting emotional wounds for those future generations to return to the same tired solution of terrorism, which is a bad answer that only gains traction in the lack of better ones.

Better answers take stable, functioning economics that work for multi national trade partnerships, the type that the Middle East has seen flourish in recent years, yet conflicts like the one in Gaza and others threaten that stability on all sides.

Further, I'm sure I and many others would prefer it to remain classified as to how many multi national corporations played some strange role in this fiasco. If part of that solution is to bring a lasting peace via economic prosperity to Israel and the entirety of the Middle East, bolstering investment partnerships in mutually profitable situations, I see this as a blessing, and I hope you do too.

### Stabilizing the Middle East Will Prevent Refugee Crises that Destabilize Europe, America, and More

The past century has seen the Middle East be a hotbed for all kinds of armed conflicts, mostly due to competition over it's prized asset: oil. Modernity challenges that necessity as many countries are embracing "green" energy options, or like the US with shale oil and expanded drilling in Alaska, are finding solutions that lessen the necessity of importing oil from the Middle East. While oil will always be a necessity for the development of plastics and more, the need to have foreign markets influence the Middle Eastern oil market is a lessening burden on all nations involved.

The past has seen that burden be a necessity which has led to many conflicts of many kinds and origins, and have resulted in a steady flow of refugee crises where people flee conflicts for safer, often European and American regions. This has destabilized European and American labor markets, inspired regional cultural difficulties, and reeked havoc on political processes.

A more stable Middle East, one that does not seek solutions to conflicts with violence and warfare, but with economics and shared prosperity, will secure a future where refugee crises are not a normal thing, and will stabilize the world in turn. That starts with the Middle East's leader: Israel.

### A Note on the IDF's History and Israeli Identity

Modern Israel's formation and sovereignty was and remains an absolute necessity after the horrors of the Holocaust and centuries of antisemitism, the latter of which shamefully continues to this day. With this formation brought another necessity: the famed Israel Defense Forces, or the IDF, Israel's military. In the early years of modern, post WWII society, European partnerships brought steady arms into Israel to secure it as a country, which led to Israel's expanded borders that we know today. Eventually, European partnerships led to American partnerships, and today the IDF benefits near entirely from the arms that America imports into it. In the past, this was much to the benefit of European and American allies of Israel, such to ensure oil as a commodity found a steady flow to those regions, which has brought us the international society we all know and love today.

However, as oil necessities shift, and refugee crises have laid a burden on America and Europe, so must Israel's IDF shift to remain in steady alliance with the interests of it's greatest benefactors.

That said, modern Israel's identity is tied tightly to the IDF, and given it's nation's policy of conscription requires the majority of it's citizenry to participate, this leads us to a question: if Israel is to shift away from being seen as the most militant nation in the Middle East, what would become of Israeli identity? Furthermore, how can we make sure something like the massacre on October 7th 2023 never happens again?

I say this: if the IDF were to shift it's focus to maintaining peace within it's country, promoting the Shin Bet to use Mossad intelligence proactively to protect Israeli borders as opposed to using the intelligence to gain advantages in conflicts outside it's borders, in tandem with European, Asian, and American nations bolstering investment in the stability of the surrounding region, **we can ensure terrorism will never strike Israel again by attacking both it's misbegotten economic beginnings and using intelligence to prevent the possibility of it's violent endings**.

Only then can we ensure another massacre like the one that occurred on October 7th 2023 never happens again to the great nation of Israel. This new future will also allow the world to see Israel and Israelis beyond it's military, such to aid the intellectual and emotional battle against modern antisemitism.

Thus, Israeli identity can shift from being one of an outward militancy, to one of culture: Jewish culture as it's greatest export, and the world's entertainers as it's greatest import.

## III. An End to the Israeli-Palestinian and Further Middle Eastern Conflict, Brought to You by the Entertainment Industry

As an American, though I am of Indian descent, when I travel abroad often the first conversation many have with me after recognizing my accent is of the entertainment America is famous for producing. This will be the destiny of Israel and the Middle East as fated by this situation, and it will help keep many of the sins that took place classified.

### The Music Industry Will Descend Upon Israel and the Middle East to Keep the Peace

Once a lasting commitment to peace is established, the musical entertainers that were inspired by these events will descend upon the Middle East as a permanent stop to their world tours and recording locations; starting with Israel and then moving outwards through the entire Middle East as the region stabilizes. Given how easy it was to make albums about me, this should be a cinch.

### The Film Industry Will Later Cement the Peace in the Middle East

Yes, a Hollywood mogul or several are culpable in part for these events. However, they alone do not control the will of the greater entertainment industry. Somehow, given my survival in this situation, I do. And thus, I command Hollywood, once peace is established, to cement the peace the Musicians will introduce by bringing your industry to film on location in Israel and the greater Middle East, and help establish entertainment outlets for and by the regions themselves.

The world often sees itself in the visage of the actors, writers, and sure maybe even some directors in front of and behind the cameras that define Hollywood moreso than it's moguls; your mission is to spread this identity and reflect it's global nature, and all to maintain a peace a century has not been able to achieve otherwise. Just make sure to give the moguls the credit.

### The Result: Classification

In a few decades time, the result of so much inspiring art and entertainment will be that several of the next generation of entertainers will be of Israeli and Middle Eastern birth, not simply descent, giving ISCAP more ammunition to maintain classification given the origin story of the future of entertainment will be political scandal.

Furthermore, this will vitalize the economics of the Middle East, not simply through the revenues of entertainment, but through the bolstered culture that song and cinema provides citizenries of all nations, educations, and backgrounds to persist in furthering their economic talents in the name of their countries. Potentially destabilizing world economies all in the name of "auto declassification" will give ISCAP pause in 22+ years.

Finally, the official story of peace will be one that belongs to those that truly arranged for it: political leadership. ISCAP will not want to disturb this reality, as it is the actual truth, and will be preserved as history in museums through the region.

### A Personal Address to the Artists Involved

To be direct to you artists: You fools made hundreds of songs, "cute" (read: not cute, at all) jokes and references in movies and TV, and played dress up while posing in photo shoots under the guise of "psychology". And all because of the unholy alliance between portions of the film industry, politicians, business "men", TV news anchors, "journalists", and the gods-of-classification knows who else attempted to ruin my life and smear my name alongside a private "spy" agency, instead of getting therapy.

When I say this is the least you can do for me, I mean that. I still expect muse taxes in some other form, though that can be discussed in a privacy I must hope still exists.

I'm putting you all on a never ending covertly overt diplomatic mission to maintain peace in the Middle East via your wares as entertainers. After and only after a lasting peace is established, of course. No, you don't have a choice - I didn't.

### Secure Netanyahu and the Likud Party's Legacy as the Ones Who Let The Middle East Dance Again

'nuff said.

## IV. Tell a Partial Story About What Happened Here to Let ISCAP in the Future Know it Would Complicate a Story Already Told

The world really ought to know that nearly the entirety of the media, particularly the news media, was being privately commandeered by a foreign "spy" agency that once was hired to purposefully suppress honest journalism, alongside a loquacious business owner who advocates for "free speech" (or whatever is happening here, it's not really to my knowledge nor is it's revelation my call). Such will make it easier to keep classified details that will derail peace and steady business interests in the future if an already sordid story is given further complications.

## V. Don't Do it For Me - Do it for Daniel Kahneman

It's a strange story - Daniel Kahneman's research as told to me through William Poundstone's _Priceless_ inspired me to start a game project with a different goal, one to marry video games to charity in a way that could spark a debate as to whether or not our pricing of such things was fully rational, but with a transparency to how the revenue was spent in honor of Milton Friedman all the same. Bruce Springsteen's song _The Promised Land_ - particularly the bridge about blowing away the lies that break your heart - inspired me to name it in kind with the tale from the Book of Exodus from the Torah and brought to the Bible's Old Testament.

I have a great suspicion Daniel Kahneman was more than aware of me and my situation, as both a psychologist and an Israeli - one who grew up in his earliest years hiding from the Nazis - and one I referred to quite a bit for his work with Amos Tversky on pricing and human rationality.

I only recently discovered he passed away last year, and how, and when. If he was aware of this situation, I shudder to think of the implications - he passed after I realized the worst of the lies, but nearly two months before I proved it a lie via my recollection of a car theft. To know he chose to end his life via assisted suicide brought me much pain upon finding out.

Though, perhaps I'm being irrational in seeing a connection where it may not exist - I can only hope it does not.

That said, Kahneman's life's work was on the subject of human rationality, and how such a thing may in fact be little more than an assumption made in the name of self assurance.

Economics, trade, and bartering may incur losses - entertainment as well - but only violence can cause the loss of life it is most known for.

I would think it would do Daniel Kahneman a great honor to see Israel shift the Middle East, and thus the World at large, to one that embraces economic solutions to problems over violent means like war. For if we cannot determine when we are rational actors and when we are not, then we can at least restrain our behaviors to those that prevent us as much as possible from risking the lives of ourselves and others due to the irrationality most often associated with violence, and end terrorism forever by opening the gates of prosperity to all peoples, no matter their locale, demographic, or creed.

And then we can all dance without fear of declassification!
